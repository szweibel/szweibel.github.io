## Overview

Reference Agent is an AI-powered reference assistant for library patrons built with Anthropic's Claude. Unlike traditional chatbots, this agent actively searches library databases and resources to answer patron reference questions, providing a more intelligent and accurate research support experience.

## Key Features

- **Active Search Integration**: Actually queries library systems and databases
- **Context-Aware**: Understands academic research contexts and library resources
- **Accurate Responses**: Reduces hallucination by grounding answers in real library data
- **Accessible Interface**: Easy-to-use for patrons of all technical levels

## Technical Approach

Built using:
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Anthropic's Claude API for natural language understanding
- Integration with library catalog systems
- Custom search and retrieval logic

## Development Status

Currently in active development with ongoing improvements to:
- Search accuracy and relevance
- Integration with additional library resources
- User interface and experience
- Response quality and citation formatting

## Related Projects

- **site-agent**: Turn any website or domain into a Claude-powered Q&A agent
- Part of broader research into AI applications in library services
- Builds on years of library technology development experience

## Mission

This project continues the commitment to using technology to improve library services and make research resources more accessible to all scholars and students.
