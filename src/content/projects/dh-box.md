## Overview

DH Box is a Digital Humanities platform that won a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Start-Up Grant in 2015. Setting up an environment for digital humanities computational work can be time-consuming and difficult. DH Box addresses this problem by streamlining installation processes and providing a DH laboratory in the cloud through simple sign-in via a web browser.

## Features

The DH Box platform comes pre-equipped with essential DH tools such as:
- IPython for interactive computing
- RStudio for statistical analysis
- Omeka for digital exhibitions
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Command line tools and text editors

## Historical Significance

DH Box represented an important step in making digital humanities tools accessible to scholars without requiring extensive technical infrastructure or local installation. The project's success and lessons learned directly informed the development of DHRIFT, which received NEH Level III Advancement Grant funding.

## Legacy

The principles established through DH Box continue to influence:
- Teaching philosophy and pedagogical approach
- DHRIFT project design
- JavaScript and Python course curriculum development
- General approach to digital humanities education at CUNY Graduate Center

## Philosophy

This work embodies the core mission of **democratizing computational literacy** - ensuring that all humanities scholars, regardless of technical background, can access and learn digital research methods.
