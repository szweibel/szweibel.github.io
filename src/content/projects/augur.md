## Overview

Augur is a web app that tracks statistics about library reference desk interactions. It improves on previous reference tracking programs by providing a better user interface, including more and clearer charts illustrating the reference data, and by using a controlled vocabulary of tags.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-use form for logging reference interactions
- **Rich Visualizations**: Multiple chart types showing patterns in reference data
- **Controlled Vocabulary**: Consistent tagging for better analysis
- **Time-based Analysis**: Track trends over time, by day, week, or month
- **Multiple Statistics**: Frequency, length, and nature of reference questions

## Impact

Hunter College Libraries and several other institutions (as far away as Nigeria) currently use Augur to track their reference statistics. The application helps libraries:
- Understand patron needs and question patterns
- Inform personnel and resource management decisions
- Document the value of reference services
- Identify areas for service improvement

## Technical Details

Built with modern web technologies for reliability and ease of use:
- JavaScript for interactive interfaces
- Data visualization libraries for charts and graphs
- Backend storage for statistical analysis
- Export capabilities for reporting

## Philosophy

This project demonstrates how custom-built library tools can better serve specific institutional needs than off-the-shelf solutions, while still being generalizable enough for adoption by other libraries.
