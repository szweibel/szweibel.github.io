## Overview

DHRIFT (Digital Humanities Resource Infrastructure for Teaching Technology) is a major digital humanities education initiative that won an NEH Level III Advancement Grant worth $300,000. As co-director, this project builds on earlier work with DH Box to democratize computational literacy in the humanities.

## Project Goals

DHRIFT aims to provide comprehensive, accessible training in digital humanities methods and tools. The project focuses on:

- Building sustainable infrastructure for DH education
- Creating open educational resources
- Training instructors and researchers across institutions
- Expanding access to computational methods in humanities research

## Impact

- **National Scope**: Supporting DH education initiatives across the United States
- **Open Resources**: All materials freely available and openly licensed
- **Community Building**: Creating networks of DH practitioners and educators
- **Sustainable Model**: Developing infrastructure that can continue beyond grant funding

## Related Work

- DH Box (NEH Start-Up Grant, 2015)
- Digital Humanities Research Institute (NEH grants 2017, 2019)
- Years of teaching JavaScript and Python to humanities graduate students
