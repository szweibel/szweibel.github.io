  content: Setting up an environment for digital humanities computational work can be time-consuming and difficult. DH Box addresses this problem by streamlining installation processes and providing a DH laboratory in the cloud through simple sign-in via a web browser. The DH Box platform comes pre-equipped with essential DH tools such as IPython, RStudio, Omeka, and NLTK.

  content: Augur is a web app that tracks statistics about library reference desk interactions. It improves on previous reference tracking programs by providing a better user interface, including more and clearer charts illustrating the reference data, and by using a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hunter College Libraries, and several other institutions (as far away as Nigeria) currently use Augur to track their reference statistics.

  content: Using the CUNY+ Catalog API allows for programmatic search of the catalog, providing results that can be used to create applications that take advantage of CUNY's holdings and metadata. As a demonstration of its utility, I created a mobile app for the Hunter College Libraries catalog, allowing users to search for resources using any web-enabled device.
