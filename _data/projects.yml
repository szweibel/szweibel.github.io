  content: Augur is a web app that tracks statistics about library reference desk interactions. It improves on previous reference tracking programs by providing a better user interface, including more and clearer charts illustrating the reference data, and by using a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hunter College Libraries, and several other institutions (as far away as Nigeria) currently use Augur to track their reference statistics.
