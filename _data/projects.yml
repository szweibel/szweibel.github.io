  content: Augur is a web app that tracks statistics about library reference desk interactions. It improves on previous reference tracking programs by providing a better user interface, including more and clearer charts illustrating the reference data, and by using a controlled vocabulary of tags. Hunter College Libraries, and several other institutions (as far away as Nigeria) currently use Augur to track their reference statistics.

  content: A radio frequency identification (RFID)-based inventory system for libraries, Know Thy Shelf allows users to scan an entire shelf of books in less than 50 seconds. Know Thy Shelf then checks the status and location of each book against the library catalog, creating a visual representation of the shelves for easy reference.

  content: Using the CUNY+ Catalog API allows for programmatic search of the catalog, providing results that can be used to create applications that take advantage of CUNY's holdings and metadata. In this way I created a mobile app of the Hunter College Libraries catalog, allowing users to search for resources using any web-enabled device.
