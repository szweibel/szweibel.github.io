            I am a librarian doing work in Emerging Technologies at Hunter College, CUNY. I'm currently studying Digital Humanities at the CUNY Graduate Center, and I like to work on digital projects tha increase access to library collections. I've written a <a href="https://github.com/szweibel" style='text-decoration: underline'>number of programs</a>.

        My primary research interests include the use of technology to improve library services, and library assessment. I also enjoy microcomputing, using devices
        like the Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
