title: Python, CSV, and Regular Expressions Hackathon
---
Some pre-written Python scripts, and a demonstration CSV to get us started on using Python and regular expressions to work with CSVs and Excel data:

* A [typical Collection Development CSV](/workshops/coldev.csv) that a librarian might want to process. Notice it has gaps, mistypings, and other idiosyncrasies. This is the challenge of processing human-created data.

* [Script for pulling cells out of a CSV according to a regular expression.](/workshops/regex.py)
* [Similar](/workshops/with_tablib.py), using the [tablib](https://github.com/kennethreitz/tablib) library.

Here are some helpful links for building regular expressions:

* [http://txt2re.com/](http://txt2re.com/). The greatest reg-ex builder on the internet. Interesting interface. Was indispensable when I was working on a reg-ex to read Library of Congress Call Numbers.
* [http://www.freeformatter.com/regex-tester.html](http://www.freeformatter.com/regex-tester.html). There are many regular expression testers online. This one has the virtue of useful options and handy documentation.
